# quiknode-bug

### Requirements

- NodeJS
- A `.env` file in with QUICKNODE_URL set

e.g. `QUICKNODE_URL=https://lingering-wispy-pine.quiknode.pro/<KEY-HERE>`

### Run the code

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

- Observe that around 5% of the time you get -

`blo is available to register`

Which is wrong, as can be seen here -
